# Drag & Drop Trello Like Board in Vanilla JS with Custom Elements

I created this repo while creating a clone of Trello and made this code public, because so far I have not found a true 1:1 implementation of this feature as it is done by Trello.

This is my attempt at reverse engineering the functionality of dragging and dropping the list elements on Trello board using [custom elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_custom_elements) as a way of getting familiar with [web components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components).

To run the project:
1. Download/clone this repo
2. Open the terminal in this project's directory and run ```npm install```.
3. Finally, run ```npm run start```, a new browser tab should open at ```http://localhost:8080/```.

Finally, if you have any questions, remarks or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me.
